   <mark>Kabaddi is a team sport that requires seven players in two teams. <br></mark>
   Kabaddi is basically a combative sport, with seven players on each side; <b>played for a period of 40 minutes with a 5 minutes break (20-5-20).</b><br>If a player goes out of bounds before being in contact with an opponent during a raid.<br>
   In Kabaddi, teams take turns sending players <b><i>(called "raiders")</b></i> across the mid line to the other team's side of the court. <i>The raider tries to<br> tag members of the other team and run back to his side within 30 seconds â€” each player he touches equals one point for his team if he makes it back safely.<br></i>
